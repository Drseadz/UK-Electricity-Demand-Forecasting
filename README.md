# UK-Electricity-Demand-Forecasting

# Introduction to the Project
Electricity demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of data-driven decision-making processes within business context.  This project serves to address complexities encountered due to use of traditional methods of electricity demand forecasting. The main objective of this project is to study past electricity usage, find useful patterns, and employ deep neural networks to predict what the future electricity demand might be.
This study utilized data pre-processing methods along with seasonal decomposition to enhance the analysis of past consumption patterns. This enhancement assists in making precise predictions and informed choices within the energy industry. We will employ LSTM and CNN-LSTM models to examine short-term electricity load patterns, leveraging three years of half-hourly demand trends.

# Project Stages
The project will be executed in three stages:
1.	Data Collection and Transformation: This involves collection of data from open-sourced data portals and implementing transformation techniques such as filtering, date incorporation, interpolation of data points, data merging and variable renaming to serve as foundation for the other aspects of the project. The sources accessed for this study include the National Grid ESO and the Met Office portals.
2.	Data Exploration and Preprocessing: This process includes analyzing the data to uncover trends and patterns, conducting seasonal decomposition analysis, scaling of features, and selecting relevant features for prediction purposes. Implementing this analysis will empower the ability to foresee shifts in customer behaviour and adjust their strategies accordingly.
3.	Model Development: This phase centres around building a predictive model capable of effectively handling forthcoming data. The effectiveness of the models will be gauged through evaluation metrics, training duration, and the loss observed during training and validation.

# Business Requirement
1.	The business need is to establish an historical analytical framework that empowers forecasting and strategy teams to pinpoint and address customer usage of electricity.
2.	Improving business policymaking, resource allocation, and energy management through the development and examination of models with the ability to accurately predict electricity demand in different regions.
3.	To improve the precision of future demand predictions by assessing the models' ability to learn consumption patterns effectively, leading to cost reduction through more precise forecasting.

# Proposed Solution
The solutions focus on meeting the defined business requirements by providing strategy teams with practical insights that elevate customer satisfaction, alleviate network overload, offer guidance on electricity use and distribution, and boost business performance. By recognizing patterns and forecasting future demand, grid operators can formulate more focused and successful strategies.
